This is a DVD Rentals dataset with a large schema consisting of 15 tables that I did exploratory query analysis on. 
The schema has primary and foreign keys than enable us to join tables together and explore endless possible results.

I created questions that I believe have complexity and are realistic questions that Data Analysts could have to answer.
