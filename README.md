This is a DVD Rentals dataset with a large schema consisting of 15 tables that I performed exploratory data analysis on. 

The schema has 15 tables with primary and foreign keys than enable us to join the tables together and explore endless possible results.

I created questions that I believe have complexity and are realistic questions that Data Analysts could have to answer.

Please reference the "DVD Rental Schema.pdf" file to see the full schema
