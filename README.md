This is a DVD Rentals dataset with a large schema consisting of 15 tables that I performed exploratory data analysis on. 

The schema has 15 tables with primary and foreign keys than enable us to join the tables together and explore endless possible results.

I created questions that I believe are complex and are realistic questions that Data Analysts need to answer.

In these questions, I demonstrate my ability to use window functions, multi-joins, CTEs, subqueries, conditionals, and more.

Please reference the "DVD Rental Schema.pdf" file to see the full schema
