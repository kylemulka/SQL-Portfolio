# SQL-Portfolio
Dataset is DVD Rentals dataset with a large schema consisting of 15 tables that we're able to join together and explore results.

I created questions that I believe have complexity and are realistic questions that Data Analysts could have to answer.

The purpose of this SQL repository is to show employers that I am capable of performing complex queries and can solve problems in creative ways!
